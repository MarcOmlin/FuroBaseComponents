# Parking data

Sometimes people want to store data in variables/properties. 
It is not necessarily needed for FBP, when the components you are using are designed appropriately.
But it is not a problem to park the payload of an event (**e.details**) to a *property*.
 
 

## Parking event-data to properties
To park data from an event (**event.detail**) just use the '@-event="((property))"' syntax.

> Note
Properties can be viewed as a special form of a wire.
