# Starterpacks and Generators

At the moment we have only one yeoman generator for creating a component project. Starterpacks to create a app
, similar to `polymer init  polymer-3-application`, will follow soon.

## generator-furo-element
This generator will generate a component project with doc viewer, demos and testing. 
The documentation is buildable with polymer build, so you can add a gh-page for your component easily.

### Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-furo-element using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-furo-element
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo furo-element
```
