# Introduction to Furo Flowbased Programming

Write your applications like you make the concept for your application. 
Normaly you draw a few components and some arrows to connect the components, to describe your intention. 
Why you donâ€™t do the same to write your app or component? Use existing web-components and wire them to build your application.

**TL/DR**: Furo-FBP is a shorthand notation for adding eventlisteners and invoking methods on elements without writing any javascript. Thats it.

But there is more then just eventlisteners in Furo-FBP. 
Watch the video below for a short introduction or read more in the [Flowbased Programming](/guide/md/fbp-wires/) section.

We also recommended the [Patterns] section, to get a better understanding how to wire the [components](/api/doc/input/) 
from the different packages to something useful.

### FBP 101

In furo-fbp you connect events from one component to methods of an ohter component. If you get this concept, you have understand
already 90% of the thing you need to write a program.
